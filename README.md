# DevOps_Intern
This is a DevOps test assignment

Task #1
There is a log.txt file.
It is necessary to use any local tools (in this case, python) to get a sorted list of all sid values in lines with IP=10.1.192.38
sid values must be without delimiting '/' characters other than those within the value

Task #2
There is an app.jar.
To run it, use the command java -jar app.jar some_out_file "Service is working!"
You need to write a daemon for systemd that will keep the application running and restart it if the process crashes.
You also need to make protection against endless restart looping.
